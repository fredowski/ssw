GNU Spread Sheet Widget is a library for Gtk+ which provides a widget for
viewing and manipulating 2 dimensional tabular data in a manner similar
to many popular spread sheet programs.

The design follows the model-view-controller paradigm and is of
complexity O(1) in both time and space.  This means that it is efficient and
fast even for very large data.

Features commonly found in graphical user interfaces such as cut and paste,
drag and drop and row/column labelling are also included.
